# Marketplace Submission Packet

Everything needed to submit both repos to the **Claude Code Community Marketplace** (`anthropics/claude-plugins-community`).

# What submission means

When Anthropic approves a submission, your plugin entry lands in [`claude-plugins-community/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-community/blob/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) (2,200+ plugins as of June 2026). Users discover and install via:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-plugins-community
/plugin install autonomous-fleet@claude-community
/plugin install agent-skills@claude-community
```

CI automatically bumps the pinned SHA when you push new commits, so future updates flow through without re-submitting.

# Two submission forms (pick ONE per repo)

🟦 **Console form** (use this — works for individual authors):
https://platform.claude.com/plugins/submit

🟪 **claude.ai form** (requires Team/Enterprise org + directory admin):
https://claude.ai/admin-settings/directory/submissions/plugins/new

Both feed the same review pipeline. Use the Console form unless you already have a Team org with directory management access.

# Pre-submission checklist (already done ✅)

- ✅ Both repos have `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` at the root
  - autonomous-fleet: `2a0f7b9664fac8c19f192bac26809ee9f7360fd4`
  - agent-skills: `813d097d0fe9fba2c30287a116034ef5ebdf3595`
- ✅ Both have `SKILL.md` files following the agentskills.io spec
- ✅ Both have full READMEs with banners + install instructions
- ✅ Both are MIT licensed
- ✅ Both have CI green on the submission SHA
- 🟡 Optional pre-submit: run `claude plugin validate` locally (the review pipeline runs the same check)

# After submission

Approved plugins are pinned to a specific commit SHA in `claude-plugins-community` and the CI automatically bumps the pin on subsequent pushes to the source repo. The public catalog syncs nightly. Check whether your plugin is installable:

```bash
grep -i "autonomous-fleet\|agent-skills" <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-community/main/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json)
```

There's no SLA on review time — usually within a few days. If you don't see it after a week, follow up on the form's reply thread or open an issue at `anthropics/claude-plugins-community`.

# Other marketplaces (optional)

These are smaller/independent registries — useful for discoverability but not required:

| Marketplace | Submit at | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 🟪 **claude-plugins-official** | (curated, no application) | Anthropic picks. Don't submit. |
| 🟦 **claude-plugins-community** | platform.claude.com/plugins/submit | **Primary target** — 2,200+ plugins |
| 🟦 **Agent Skill Hub** | https://agentskillhub.dev | GitHub import via web UI |
| 🟦 **skills.re** | https://skills.re/submit | GitHub URL import |
| 🟦 **agentskillsindex.com** | https://agentskillsindex.com | Public registry |
| 🟦 **SkillsMP** | https://skillsmp.com | Manus marketplace mirror |
| 🟦 **aiskillstore/marketplace** | github.com/aiskillstore/marketplace (PR) | Security-audited mirror |

The Community marketplace is by far the highest-value submission. Everything else is nice-to-have.
